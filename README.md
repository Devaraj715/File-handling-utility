Key Features:

1. File Writing (writeToFile):

Creates or overwrites a file with specified content.

Writes two predefined lines of text to the file.

2. File Reading (readFromFile):

Reads the content of the file line by line and prints it to the console.

Ensures file content is accessible for verification.

3. File Modification (modifyFile):

Appends additional content to an existing file without overwriting it.

Adds a predefined line of text to the file.

4. Error Handling:

Catches and reports exceptions related to file I/O operations.

Prints stack traces for debugging in case of errors.

5. User Interaction:

Provides clear console messages to inform the user of operations being performed and their success.

6. Resource Management:

Uses try-with-resources to automatically close file streams, ensuring efficient resource handling.

Objectives:

1. Demonstrate Basic File I/O in Java:

Show how to read, write, and append to text files using BufferedWriter and BufferedReader.

2. Handle Common File Operations:

Perform essential file manipulations (write, read, modify) in a structured way.

3. Provide a Modular Design:

Use separate methods for distinct operations to improve readability, maintainability, and reusability.

4. Ensure Data Persistence:

Save data to a file so it can be accessed and modified later.

5. Illustrate Exception Handling:

Safeguard against I/O errors, ensuring the program doesnâ€™t crash unexpectedly.

6. Educate on Best Practices:

Show efficient resource management using try-with-resources.

Provide clean separation of concerns between methods.
